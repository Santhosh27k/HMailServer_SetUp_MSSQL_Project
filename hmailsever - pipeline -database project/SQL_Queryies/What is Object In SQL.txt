🧩 What is an Object in SQL Server?

In SQL Server, an object is any individual structure or entity in the database that you can create, store, or manipulate.

Think of it as things inside the database that you can interact with — like tools in a toolbox.

🔹 Common SQL Server Objects

Object Type		|		Description
------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
Table			|	Stores rows and columns of data (like an Excel sheet).
View			|	A virtual table based on a query (doesn’t store data itself).
Stored Procedure	|	A precompiled SQL code block that performs actions or tasks.
Function		|	A reusable piece of code that returns a value or table.
Trigger			|	A procedure that automatically runs when data changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
Index			|	Improves query performance by speeding up data retrieval.
Constraint		|	Rules applied to columns or tables to enforce data integrity (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK).
Schema			|	A container that groups database objects logically.
Sequence		|	Generates numeric values in a specific order.
Synonym			|	An alias for another database object (like a shortcut).

🔹 Key Points About Objects

1.Each object has a name (e.g., Employees, GetAllEmployees).

2.Each object lives in a database — you must be in the right database to see it.

3.All objects are stored in system catalogs (like sys.objects or sys.tables), which SQL Server uses to keep track of everything.

----------------------------------------------------------

🔹 Example: Listing All Objects in Current Database

			SELECT name, type_desc
			FROM sys.objects;


This will show:

	*Tables

	*Views

	*Stored procedures

	*Functions

	*Triggers
		…everything inside the current database.

🔹 Visual Analogy

Imagine your database is a library:

	Tables → bookshelves

	Views → reading guides (virtual view of books)

	Stored Procedures → library assistants that do tasks for you

	Functions → calculators to get specific info from books

	Triggers → alarms that ring when something changes

	Indexes → an index at the back of a book to find info quickly


✅ Summary

An object in SQL Server is any named entity inside a database that stores, organizes, or manipulates data.
